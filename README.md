## SwimTracker
Currently creating a swimming practice application to track the distance that swimmers are required to spend in each zone of intensity. 
This project is building a Node.js Restful CRUD API using Express, Sequelize with PostgreSQL database as well as React for the frontend integration.

# Reason
Coaches often write practices thinking that they are focusing on a specific zone of intensity such as V02 Max or Endurance but end up creating a practice that does not hit that zone of intensity correctly. This application will be used to demonstrate to the coach how much time he is actually spending in each zone.
